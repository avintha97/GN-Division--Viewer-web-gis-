# NextGIS Dashboard — App Overview 🗺️

NextGIS Dashboard is a lightweight WebGIS viewer built with Next.js and OpenLayers, with Turf.js powering accurate geospatial calculations. It focuses on exploring GN/ADM3 divisions and visualizing a single selected geometry at a time.

- 🗺️ Interactive map (OpenLayers) with a dark basemap for clear visualization
- 🔎 Left collapsible sidebar with filterable GN Divisions selection and attributes
- 🎯 Selected-only rendering: only the chosen division is overlaid to keep the map uncluttered
- 📐 Turf.js computations for geodesic area and perimeter (accurate measurements)

Use this app as a starting point for WebGIS dashboards, data exploration, or prototyping spatial UX.
